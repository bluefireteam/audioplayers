## Checklist
- [ ] I made sure that the feature I am proposing doesn't already exist

## Use case / Problem
<!-- Which problem would be solved with this feature? -->
<!-- Why it fits in this package (and not a standalone package for example) -->

## Proposal / Solution
<!-- What do you propose as a solution? Add as much information as you can! -->
<!-- What API changes that are necessary?-->
<!-- Are there any breaking changes expected? 
     Is it a new flag to pass through to android/ios?
     Is it just manageable with some build in functions?
-->

<details>
  <summary>Example Code</summary>

  <!-- Unless your feature requires no API changes whatsoever, provide a very concise code example of how it would be used in a Flutter app. 
       This is **mandatory** if your feature requires any API changes. 
       You **must** use code blocks to put your code in. 
       You can link an example repo (unnecessary) but you must add a simple version on the issue.
  -->

  ```dart
  void main() {
  }
  ```
</details>

## Platforms
<!-- Make sure to identify for which platforms this must be implemented -->

Affected Platforms: <!-- all, android, ios, web, macos, linux, windows -->

<!-- First, assess if this already exists or not on some platforms but not on others. 
     Some stuff we currently only support on Android or only on iOS because Open Source projects are made with the help 
     of the community and we not always have time to do everything. 
     If, for example, you want an iOS feature to be added to android, that is totally fine but specify that here. 
     In this case, provide in the sections above a clear explanation of how it already works on all platforms its 
     present on (e.g. the Code section must include code for how to use it on platform X and what changes 
     (if any, probably none) are necessary on the api level to add it to platform Y).
-->
<!-- Secondly, asses in which platforms this make sense to be added. 
     Especially web/macos. There are some features that just don't make sense outside of the mobile world, for example. 
     Not everything needs to be present on all platforms. Please think about which platforms this should be added for, ideally. 
     That doesn't mean we will end up doing all of them to start, but just as the goal.
-->
<!-- This is also a perfect section to include, if your prior research already revealed it, 
     if there are minimum OS versions that are absolutely required to add this feature. 
     For example, if it's only possible to do it after Android 23, add that detail here.
-->

## Audio Files/URLs/Sources (optional)
<!-- If your feature request involves a new type of file, a different URL, stream type, etc., 
     please provide here any resources that would be required to test or develop your feature. 
     For example, if you wanted to play a different kind of file, please provide such file.
-->

## Mockups (optional)
<!-- If applicable, add mockup screenshots or videos to help to explain what this feature would look like. 
     It can also be screenshots/screen recordings of existing apps, built using other libraries (like native libraries), 
     to do what you want, or of how it works on other platforms if it already exists on audioplayers on some platforms.
-->

## More information (optional)
<!-- Do you have any other useful information about this feature report? Please write it down here -->
<!-- During your research for your use case, you might have encountered some existing apps using this feature through 
     other (maybe native) libraries, tutorials explaining how to do it on the native side, 
     articles explaining why this is useful for end users, etc. 
     Add here any links or references that you have to help to make your case for this feature. 
     This is highly encouraged if your feature is anything bigger or more complex.
-->
<!-- Are you interested in working on a PR for this? -->
