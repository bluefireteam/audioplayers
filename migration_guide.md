# Migration Guide

We are currently in process of testing v1 via release candidates. Despite several major infrastructural changes, it should be very easy to migrate for end users, as things overall just got simpler.

First step is to add the current release candidate (RC1) to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
  dependencies:
    audioplayers: ^1.0.0-rc.1
```

This document contains the list of major changes to be aware of.
