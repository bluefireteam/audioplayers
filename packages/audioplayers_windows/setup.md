# Setup for Windows

Please follow the Flutter guide to [set up Flutter on Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#windows-setup).

Optionally you can add the individual component `NuGet package manager` inside **Visual Studio** or **Visual Studio Build Tools**, otherwise it will be downloaded while building.
