/// how is it played by the device and what happens when the app is
/// backgrounded.
/// However, note that each platform has its nuances on how to configure audio.
/// This class is a generic abstraction of some parameters that can be useful
/// across the board.
/// Its flags are simple abstractions that are then translated to an
/// [AudioContext] containing platform specific configurations:
/// [AudioContextAndroid] and [AudioContextIOS].
/// If these simplified flags cannot fully reflect your goals, you must create
/// an [AudioContext] configuring each platform separately.

  ///
  /// On iOS, it will either:
  ///
  /// * set the `.defaultToSpeaker` option OR
  /// * call `overrideOutputAudioPort(AVAudioSession.PortOverride.speaker)`

  /// On Android, this will make an Audio Focus request with
  /// AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK when your audio starts playing.
  ///
  /// On iOS, this will set the option `.duckOthers` option
  /// (the option `.mixWithOthers` is always set, regardless of these flags).

  ///
  /// On Android, this will mandate the `USAGE_NOTIFICATION_RINGTONE` usage
  /// type.
